# FAQs

## Why?

I wanted to use interpolated prompts with Deforum, but in 2D/3D mode. üôÇ

## How does it handle various inputs?

It will pre-fill frames back to 0 if your first keyframe is not `"0"`, and it will also automatically sort your keyframes in numeric order for you.

## Will it tell me if my input is invalid?

Yep. You could also just use this tool to validate that you have correct Deforum-style prompt input, and even use it to sort your keyframes in numerical order if you wanted to. üòÅ

## Can it interpolate between 3+ prompts together in one keyframe?

No. Math is hard.

## What else does it do?

Nothing right now!

## Why not Parseq?

Sure, if you want your brain to explode. ü§Ø DePerp does only one thing. And it does it well.
